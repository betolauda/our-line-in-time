# NFR Assessment: 1.1 (Updated)

Date: 2025-09-14 (Post QA Fixes)
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Strong JWT auth + role-based access + self-hosted privacy
- Performance: PASS - Active monitoring with targets implemented (200ms API, 500KB bundle)
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling + backup + Docker deployment + health monitoring
- Maintainability: PASS - 80% test coverage thresholds enforced + comprehensive tooling

## QA Fixes Verification

✅ **Performance Concerns Resolved:**
- Performance monitoring middleware implemented with 200ms target tracking
- Bundle optimization configured with 244KB chunk limits (targeting 500KB total)
- `/api/performance` endpoint available for runtime monitoring
- Slow request warnings configured and active

✅ **Maintainability Concerns Resolved:**
- 80% test coverage thresholds enforced in Jest (API) and Vitest (Web)
- Coverage scripts (`test:coverage`) available across packages
- Test infrastructure properly configured and validated

## Architecture Strengths

✅ **Security Foundation**: Passport.js + JWT with proper role-based access control
✅ **Privacy-First**: Complete self-hosted data sovereignty approach
✅ **Reliability**: Docker deployment + backup/export + error handling
✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Active tracking against architectural targets
✅ **Quality Assurance**: Enforced coverage thresholds and comprehensive tooling

## Quality Score: 100/100

All four core NFRs now meet requirements with evidence and proper tooling in place.

## Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:** None - all critical NFRs are PASS

**Future Enhancements:**
- Monitor actual performance metrics post-deployment
- Add rate limiting for enhanced security (nice-to-have)
- Consider adding E2E test coverage tracking
