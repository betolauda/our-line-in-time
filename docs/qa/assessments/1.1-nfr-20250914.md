# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-09-14
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Strong JWT auth + role-based access + self-hosted privacy
- Performance: CONCERNS - Architecture ready but no measurements against targets
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling + backup + Docker deployment implemented
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Good structure but test coverage needs verification

## Critical Issues

1. **No performance measurements** (Performance)
   - Risk: May not meet <200ms API / <500KB bundle targets
   - Fix: Add performance monitoring and bundle analysis to build process

2. **Test coverage unverified** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Insufficient test coverage for production deployment
   - Fix: Verify Jest/Vitest test implementation and coverage reporting

## Quick Wins

- Add bundle analyzer to frontend build: ~1 hour
- Add API response time monitoring: ~2 hours
- Verify test coverage setup: ~1 hour
- Add performance CI checks: ~2 hours

## Architecture Strengths

✅ **Security Foundation**: Passport.js + JWT with proper role-based access control
✅ **Privacy-First**: Complete self-hosted data sovereignty approach
✅ **Reliability**: Docker deployment + backup/export + error handling
✅ **Structure**: Well-organized monorepo with TypeScript + shared packages
