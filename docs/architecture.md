# Our Line in Time Fullstack Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Our Line in Time**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template Analysis

**Result:** N/A - Greenfield Project

Your PRD indicates this is a greenfield project with self-hosting requirements and family-focused privacy. No existing templates mentioned, but I recommend considering:

- **T3 Stack** (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + Tailwind) for rapid prototyping
- **Custom Docker-based solution** for better self-hosting control

**Recommendation:** Custom approach to meet self-hosting and privacy requirements.

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

Our Line in Time employs a **privacy-first, self-hosted fullstack architecture** with a Next.js 15 frontend and Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions for multimedia + geographic + temporal data storage. The system follows a **Turbo monorepo structure** with npm workspaces, featuring shared TypeScript packages for type safety and consistency across the stack. The platform supports multimedia handling with EXIF extraction, MinIO object storage, and Redis caching, all deployed via Docker containers to enable family members to collaborate on memory preservation while maintaining complete data sovereignty.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Self-Hosted Docker Infrastructure
**Key Services:** Docker, PostgreSQL with PostGIS, Redis, MinIO (S3-compatible), Nginx
**Deployment Host and Regions:** Local/NAS deployment with optional cloud backup

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Turbo monorepo with npm workspaces
**Monorepo Tool:** Turbo for build orchestration with npm workspaces
**Package Organization:**
- **apps/**: `@our-line-in-time/web` (Next.js), `@our-line-in-time/api` (Express.js)
- **packages/**: `@our-line-in-time/shared` (TypeScript types/schemas), `@our-line-in-time/ui` (React components)

### Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack + API Architecture:** Static frontend with dynamic API backend - _Rationale:_ Enables offline-first family memories with real-time collaboration when needed
- **Component-Based UI:** Modular React components with TypeScript - _Rationale:_ Supports diverse user interfaces from child-friendly to adult advanced views
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access for multimedia/geographic/temporal data - _Rationale:_ Enables future database migrations and testing of complex spatial queries
- **Event-Driven Collaboration:** WebSocket events for real-time family editing - _Rationale:_ Multiple family members can simultaneously contribute to memory documentation
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Organize code around Memory, Location, Timeline, Family domains - _Rationale:_ Aligns with your PRD's core concepts and milestone progression
- **CQRS for Complex Queries:** Separate read/write models for geographic-temporal queries - _Rationale:_ Optimizes performance for complex "show memories near location X during time period Y" queries

## Security and Performance

### Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`
- XSS Prevention: Content sanitization, React's built-in XSS protection, input validation
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, sensitive data encrypted in localStorage

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Joi schema validation on all endpoints, SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP, 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user
- CORS Policy: `origin: ['https://family-memories.local'], credentials: true, methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']`

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: JWT in httpOnly cookies with secure flag, refresh token rotation
- Session Management: Redis-based sessions with 24-hour expiry, automatic logout on inactivity
- Password Policy: Minimum 12 characters, bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds, no common passwords

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB initial load, < 1MB total assets
- Loading Strategy: Progressive loading, image lazy loading, code splitting by route
- Caching Strategy: Service worker caching, API response caching (5 minutes), static asset caching (1 year)

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for API calls, < 500ms for complex geographic queries
- Database Optimization: PostgreSQL query optimization, PostGIS spatial indexes, connection pooling
- Caching Strategy: Redis caching for frequently accessed data (1 hour TTL), memory caching for static data

## Coding Standards

### Critical Fullstack Rules

- **Type Sharing:** Always define types in packages/shared and import from there - ensures frontend/backend consistency
- **API Calls:** Never make direct HTTP calls - use the service layer for consistent error handling and authentication
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never process.env directly - enables proper validation and defaults
- **Error Handling:** All API routes must use the standard error handler - provides consistent error responses and logging
- **State Updates:** Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns for predictable updates
- **Database Queries:** Always use parameterized queries - prevents SQL injection and enables query optimization
- **Geographic Data:** Use PostGIS spatial types and functions - ensures accurate geographic calculations and indexing
- **Privacy Enforcement:** Check family member permissions before data access - maintains multi-generational privacy
- **Media Processing:** Handle file uploads asynchronously with status tracking - prevents blocking family interactions
- **Real-time Updates:** Use WebSocket events for collaborative features - enables seamless family collaboration

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Frontend | Backend | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| Components | PascalCase | - | `MemoryCard.tsx` |
| Hooks | camelCase with 'use' | - | `useAuth.ts` |
| Services | PascalCase classes | PascalCase classes | `MemoryService` |
| API Routes | - | kebab-case | `/api/memories/{memory-id}` |
| Database Tables | - | snake_case | `family_members` |
| Types/Interfaces | PascalCase | PascalCase | `FamilyMember` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` |

### Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ApiError {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

### Frontend Error Handling

```typescript
// apps/web/src/utils/errorHandler.ts
export class FamilyErrorHandler {
  static handleApiError(error: ApiError, showToast: boolean = true): string {
    const { code, message, details } = error.error;

    // Family-friendly error messages
    const friendlyMessages: Record<string, string> = {
      'INVALID_COORDINATES': 'Please check the location you entered',
      'EDIT_CONFLICT': 'Another family member is editing this memory',
      'INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS': 'You don\'t have permission for this action',
      'MEMORY_NOT_FOUND': 'This memory couldn\'t be found',
      'UPLOAD_TOO_LARGE': 'This file is too large to upload',
      'INVALID_DATE_RANGE': 'Please check your start and end dates'
    };

    const friendlyMessage = friendlyMessages[code] || 'Something went wrong. Please try again.';

    if (showToast) {
      // Show user-friendly toast notification
      toast.error(friendlyMessage);
    }

    // Log detailed error for debugging
    console.error('API Error:', { code, message, details });

    return friendlyMessage;
  }

  static handleNetworkError(): string {
    const message = 'Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection.';
    toast.error(message);
    return message;
  }

  static handleValidationError(errors: Record<string, string[]>): void {
    Object.entries(errors).forEach(([field, messages]) => {
      messages.forEach(message => {
        toast.error(`${field}: ${message}`);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

### Backend Error Handling

```typescript
// apps/api/src/middleware/error.middleware.ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';

export interface AppError extends Error {
  statusCode?: number;
  code?: string;
  details?: any;
}

export function errorHandler(
  error: AppError,
  req: Request,
  res: Response,
  next: NextFunction
): void {
  const requestId = uuidv4();
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();

  // Log error details
  logger.error('API Error', {
    requestId,
    error: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    code: error.code,
    statusCode: error.statusCode,
    url: req.originalUrl,
    method: req.method,
    userId: (req as any).user?.id,
    timestamp
  });

  // Family-friendly error responses
  const statusCode = error.statusCode || 500;
  const errorCode = error.code || 'INTERNAL_ERROR';

  const errorResponse = {
    error: {
      code: errorCode,
      message: getPublicErrorMessage(errorCode, error.message),
      details: statusCode >= 500 ? undefined : error.details,
      timestamp,
      requestId
    }
  };

  res.status(statusCode).json(errorResponse);
}

function getPublicErrorMessage(code: string, originalMessage: string): string {
  // Don't expose internal error details to family members
  const publicMessages: Record<string, string> = {
    'VALIDATION_ERROR': 'Please check your input and try again',
    'UNAUTHORIZED': 'Please log in to continue',
    'FORBIDDEN': 'You don\'t have permission for this action',
    'NOT_FOUND': 'The requested item could not be found',
    'CONFLICT': 'This item is being edited by another family member',
    'INTERNAL_ERROR': 'Something went wrong on our end. Please try again later.'
  };

  return publicMessages[code] || 'An unexpected error occurred';
}

// Custom error classes for family platform
export class ValidationError extends Error implements AppError {
  statusCode = 400;
  code = 'VALIDATION_ERROR';

  constructor(message: string, public details?: any) {
    super(message);
  }
}

export class ConflictError extends Error implements AppError {
  statusCode = 409;
  code = 'EDIT_CONFLICT';

  constructor(message: string, public conflicts?: any) {
    super(message);
    this.details = { conflicts };
  }
}

export class PrivacyError extends Error implements AppError {
  statusCode = 403;
  code = 'PRIVACY_VIOLATION';

  constructor(message: string = 'Access denied due to privacy settings') {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Simple analytics with privacy focus, React error boundaries, performance metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Winston logging, basic health checks, database connection monitoring
- **Error Tracking:** Custom error logging (no external services for family privacy)
- **Performance Monitoring:** Response time tracking, database query performance, memory usage

### Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- JavaScript errors and stack traces
- API response times from client perspective
- User interactions (memory creation, map usage, collaboration events)

**Backend Metrics:**
- Request rate and response times by endpoint
- Error rate and error types
- Database query performance and connection pool usage
- Memory and CPU usage for family-scale deployment

```typescript
// Simple family-focused monitoring
export class FamilyMonitor {
  static trackMemoryCreation(memoryId: string, userId: string) {
    logger.info('Family Activity', {
      event: 'memory_created',
      memoryId,
      userId,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }

  static trackCollaboration(sessionId: string, participants: string[]) {
    logger.info('Family Collaboration', {
      event: 'collaboration_session',
      sessionId,
      participantCount: participants.length,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }

  static trackPerformance(endpoint: string, duration: number) {
    logger.info('Performance', {
      endpoint,
      duration,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
}
